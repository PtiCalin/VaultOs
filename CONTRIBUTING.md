## 🛠️ Ways to Contribute

VaultOS is engineered for extensibility. You can contribute by:

- 🧩 **Creating a Subplugin** – Propose or build a `vaultos_` prefixed module  
- 🪄 **Enhancing Core Scripts** – Improve the logger, scaffolder, watcher, or compiler logic  
- 🧪 **Refining Templates** – Upgrade or add templates used for subplugin scaffolding  
- 🐛 **Reporting Bugs** – Help squash bugs in the file ops, watcher, or view systems  
- ⚙️ **Improving Configs** – Propose changes to `vaultos_config_extended.json` or related logic  
- 📖 **Writing Docs** – Clarify systems, write walkthroughs, or improve the README & usage guides  

Start by [opening an Issue](https://github.com/PtiCalin/VaultOS/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template.  
We accept direct Pull Requests for smaller improvements — bigger changes are best discussed first.

## 🧠 Design Principles

VaultOS is built on a philosophy of:

- 🧱 **Modularity** — Each subplugin operates independently in a sandboxed scope  
- 🧠 **Self-documenting Systems** — Code and config should explain themselves  
- ⚡ **Local-first Automation** — VaultOS empowers creators to run rich operations inside Obsidian  
- 🛠️ **Structured Chaos** — Let ideas flow, but build with architectural intention  
- 🌱 **Progressive Enhancement** — Every version improves the core or expands creative potential
