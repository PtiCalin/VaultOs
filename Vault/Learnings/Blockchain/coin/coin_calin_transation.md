Perfect! Let's begin designing the **transaction model** for Calin Coin, building on your blockchain's current architecture.

## 🧱 Current Status Recap

You're running a functioning educational blockchain with:

- Secure key generation via `secp256k1`
- Custom password + 2FA wallet onboarding
- Block + chain validation
- Transaction verification rules (`sum(txn.values()) == 0`, no overdrafts)

Now you want to **define a formal transaction model** — the structure, types, metadata, and logic of what a transaction _is_ in Calin Coin.

## 🧾 Calin Coin Transaction Model (Draft v1.0)

### 🔹 Transaction Schema

Each transaction should be represented as a dictionary (or JSON object) with the following structure:

```json

{
  "type": "transfer",                // or "mint", "burn", "contract_call"
  "timestamp": 1715739000,          // UNIX timestamp
  "sender": "CAL1abc123...",        // public wallet address of sender
  "recipient": "CAL1def456...",     // public wallet address of recipient
  "amount": 10,                     // number of Calin Coins
  "fee": 0.01,                      // transaction fee
  "nonce": 5,                       // sender's transaction counter
  "signature": "<digital signature>" // secp256k1 signature of this payload
}

```

### 🔹 Supported Transaction Types

|Type|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`transfer`|Move Calin Coins between users|
|`mint`|Create new Calin Coins (only valid by authorized keys)|
|`burn`|Destroy coins permanently|
|`contract_call`|Call a smart contract with input data (future proof)|

---

### 🔐 Validation Rules

1. **Transfer**:
    - Sender ≠ recipient
    - Sender balance ≥ (amount + fee)
    - Signature must match sender’s public key
    - Nonce must increment from sender’s last tx
2. **Mint**:
    - Only allowed by system authority or governance contract
    - No recipient overdraft allowed
3. **Burn**:
    - Sender balance ≥ amount
    - Amount deducted and removed from total supply
4. **Contract Call** _(Future)_:
    - Validate contract address
    - Validate data and gas (if applicable)
    - Check function hash and parameters

---

### 📦 Transaction Lifecycle (Planned)

1. **User signs the transaction locally** with their private key
2. **Broadcasted** to the peer-to-peer network
3. **Collected into mempool** by block producer
4. **Validated** → If valid, added to the next block
5. **Block is mined/signed and added** to chain
6. **All nodes update state** according to transactions in the block

---

### ✅ Next Steps

To proceed, we can:

-  Code this data model into a `Transaction` class or factory function
-  Add signature verification using your current ECDSA keys
-  Expand your block structure to store full transaction objects (not just dicts)
-  Simulate a few transactions (valid + invalid) and validate them manually

Would you like to begin with the class-based implementation of the transaction model? Or continue working with pure dictionaries first to keep it lightweight?
