## 📘 What is the Python Language Reference?

The **Python Language Reference** is the official and detailed specification of how Python works as a language. It’s not a tutorial—it’s the rules.

### 📜 What It Covers

- Lexical structure (how code is parsed)
- Syntax rules (how statements are structured)
- Built-in types and data model
- Function definitions, scoping, classes
- The import system, exceptions, and more

---

### 🔍 Who Is It For?

- People writing tools that need to parse Python
- Advanced learners exploring how features really work
- Those writing compilers, interpreters, or linters
