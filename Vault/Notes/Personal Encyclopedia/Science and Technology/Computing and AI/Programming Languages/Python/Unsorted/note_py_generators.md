## 🔄 What is a Generator?

Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples—but instead of holding all values in memory, they **generate values on the fly** using the `yield` keyword.

They are ideal for large datasets or infinite streams.

---

### 🧪 Basic Example

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        yield i
        i += 1

for num in count_up_to(3):
    print(num)
```

🧠 Output:

```txt
1
2
3
```

### 🔍 Generator vs Return

- `return` exits and hands back a single value
- `yield` pauses execution and resumes later

---

### 💡 Use Cases

- Reading large files line by line
- Producing infinite sequences
- Streaming data pipelines

---

### 🔗 Related Concepts

- `yield from` syntax
- Generator expressions
- Coroutines (async/await)
