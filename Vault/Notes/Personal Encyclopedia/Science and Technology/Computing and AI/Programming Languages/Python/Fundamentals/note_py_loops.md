### 🔁 Loops in Python

Loops let you execute blocks of code repeatedly. Python supports `for` and `while` loops.

---

### 🧪 For Loop Example

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

---

### 🌀 While Loop Example

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

---

### 💡 Control Flow

- `break` – Exit loop early
- `continue` – Skip to next iteration
- `else` – Runs after loop if no `break` occurred
