## 🔍 Python Conditions — If, Elif, Else

Conditional statements let you run code based on whether a condition is `True`. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` — with colons and indentation to define blocks.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- `if` starts the condition chain
- `elif` = “else if” — check another condition if the first was false
- `else` = fallback if none of the above matched
- Conditions must end with a colon `:`
- Indentation defines what runs in each block

```python
x = 10

if x > 15:
    print("Large")
elif x > 5:
    print("Medium")
else:
    print("Small")
```

---

### 💡 Tips

- Boolean expressions use `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Use `and`, `or`, `not` for compound conditions
- Always indent blocks (standard: 4 spaces)
- Python doesn’t use parentheses or braces — just logic and spacing

---

## 🧪 Experimental Log

### 🔸 Trial 1: Basic Condition

```python
if True:
    print("This runs")
```

→ As expected.

---

### 🔸 Trial 2: Multiple Elif Blocks

```python
temp = 22

if temp > 30:
    print("Hot")
elif temp > 20:
    print("Nice")
elif temp > 10:
    print("Cool")
else:
    print("Cold")
```

→ Prints `"Nice"` — only the first matching block runs. Good to know.

---

### 🔸 Trial 3: Chaining with `and`

```python
age = 25
if age > 18 and age < 30:
    print("Young adult")
```

→ Worked. Tried again using:

```python
if 18 < age < 30:
```

→ Also valid. Python allows chained comparisons.

---

## 🌀 Thoughts

- I keep forgetting the colon at the end of `if` and `elif` lines.
- Chained comparisons like `18 < age < 30` are weirdly elegant.
- `elif` feels cleaner than a nested `if` — makes reading easier.
- No parentheses needed is still hard to get used to, coming from other languages.
