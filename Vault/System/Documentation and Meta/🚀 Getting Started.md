## 🌈 Mindset for Success

- 🌱 **Start Small:** You don't need to "finish" anything. Progress is circular, not linear.
- 🛠️ **Build As You Learn:** Knowledge becomes permanent when you apply it.
- 🎮 **Gamify It:** Treat each note, link, and project like a small quest.
- ✨ **Stay Playful:** Mistakes are part of building mastery!
