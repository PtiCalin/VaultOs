# 🗂️ Naming Conventions Index

This is the central index for all naming conventions in the Awesome Test Vault.  
It establishes a consistent, scalable system for naming files, folders, metadata, and templates — to ensure clarity across workflows, automation, and collaboration.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The naming system supports:
- 🔍 Searchability
- 🧩 Automation
- 📊 Dashboard integration
- 🤝 Collaboration and clarity

---

## 📛 Format Convention

All naming convention files follow the hybrid pattern:

> `sys_[folder-code]-[item-name].md`

Example:  
- `sys_nc-media.md` → Naming Convention for media  
- `sys_nc-yaml.md` → Naming Convention for YAML metadata fields
