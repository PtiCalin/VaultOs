utils/ is short for utilities — it's a common convention in software projects to house generic, reusable helper functions or scripts that:

Don’t belong to one specific module

Are used by multiple other scripts

Make your code cleaner, shorter, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### 🔧 What Goes in utils/?

Think of it as your vault's Swiss Army knife drawer 🧰. It might include:

### 🧠 General-purpose helpers

file_helpers.py – file path handling, renaming, existence checks

'yaml_tools.py' – load/save/validate YAML

'slugify.py' – convert titles to URL-safe or filename-safe strings

'time_utils.py' – date formatting, timestamp handling

### 🔁 Reusable logic across scripts

Logging functions used in both your mapper.py and autosorter.py

A vault_walk() function used in multiple scripts to crawl the vault structure

Shared config loaders

### 🧼 Why Keep It Separate?

Putting all these into utils/ lets your main scripts stay focused and readable.

Putting all these into utils/ lets your main scripts stay focused and readable.

```python

# Instead of doing all this inline:

with open(path) as f:

    data = yaml.safe_load(f)


# You just do:

from utils.yaml_tools import load_yaml

data = load_yaml(path)

Would you like me to generate a starter set of utils/ scripts for your vault (e.g., yaml_tools.py, vault_walk.py, slugify.py)?
